# hello-world

My first repository

Hi members,

I'm Chathuranga Adikari from Sri Lanka. I am a Software Engineering student of UWE (Northshore). I like java, php, html, android and many other software developing tools & languages. I was inspired by @dilumn_ to join github and make contributions to the opensource.       Thank you.
